        <h1>Basketball</h1>
        <p>I was on the Live Oak school JV team (6th and 7th grade team) and now play Varsity (8th grade).
            I played in the YMCA Youth Basketball League from 2019 to 2022.
            I play point guard and shooting guard. I also just play for fun with friends!
