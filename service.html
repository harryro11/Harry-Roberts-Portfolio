        <p>Tech Internship - I volunteered at my school this summer to prepare iPads for the upcoming school year, support mobile device management, reimage devices, and test classroom equipment. I also helped clean and organize the ChangeMaker Lab and set up projects for the school year. It was a great way to use my tech skills to help my school.</p>
