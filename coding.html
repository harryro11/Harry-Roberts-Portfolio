        <h1>Coding</h1>
        <p>I work with Python, Scratch, Java, and HTML, and I enjoy using these languages to bring creative ideas to life. Iâ€™ve taken a beginner course in Robotics and Circuitry, which inspired me to start learning Arduino to deepen my understanding of hardware and coding integration.
            Some examples of my work include building a ChatBot in Python that uses AI to write lines of code and designing and coding a web portfolio to showcase my projects. These experiences have allowed me to explore problem-solving, creativity, and innovation in the tech space.
