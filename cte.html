        <h1>Counselor In Training</h1>
        <p>This summer, I had the opportunity to be a CIT for a camp run by my former kindergarten teacher. I spent 5 hrs/day for a week working with Pre-K through 4th grade students. It is an outdoor field-trip camp. I assisted the teacher by engaging the students in fun activities, caring for them, taking them on field trips around SF, and ensuring their safety. 
            I continue to work for this program during the school year on school holidays.</p>
