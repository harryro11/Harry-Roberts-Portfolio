        <h1>3D Modeling</h1>
        <p>I first explored 3D modeling through an after-school program where I learned to use Blender. Since then, I’ve worked on various personal projects, including designing a skateboard, a dumbbell, and a vase.
            I’ve also brought many of my designs to life through 3D printing. Some of the items I’ve created include headphone holders, repair supports for a clothing rail, a wheel and piston arrangement, a hand-cranked fan, and keychains and figures, which I’ve gifted to friends. These projects allow me to combine creativity with problem-solving, and I enjoy turning ideas into functional, tangible products.
