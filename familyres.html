        <h1>Family Responsibilitie</h1>
        <p>My family responsibilities include, babysitting my younger sister (age 8) and taking care of my dog Alfie. I have an eight-year-old sister whom I babysit regularly (we love to practice soccer and other ball games). I am also responsible for part of my dog Alfie's care, which includes walking, feeding, and playing with him.</p>
